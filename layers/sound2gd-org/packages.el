;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `sound2gd-org-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `sound2gd-org/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `sound2gd-org/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `sound2gd-org/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:

(defconst sound2gd-org-packages
  '(org-bullets
    org-pomodoro
    ))

(defun sound2gd-org/post-init-org-bullets ()
  ;; ËÆæÁΩÆorg-headerÁöÑbullet
  ;; (setq org-bullets-bullet-list '("‚ò∞" "‚ò∑" "‚òØ" "‚ò≠"))
  )

(defun sound2gd-org/post-init-org-pomodoro ()
  (progn
    (add-hook 'org-pomodoro-finished-hook '(lambda () (sound2gd/growl-notification "Pomodoro Finished" "‚òïÔ∏è Have a break!" t)))
    (add-hook 'org-pomodoro-short-break-finished-hook '(lambda () (sound2gd/growl-notification "Short Break" "üêù Ready to Go?" t)))
    (add-hook 'org-pomodoro-long-break-finished-hook '(lambda () (sound2gd/growl-notification "Long Break" " üí™ Ready to Go?" t)))
    ))
